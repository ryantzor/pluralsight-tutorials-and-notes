## Motivation

The **main reason** I started this project is because the only way I learn is to take notes and modify code. I am currently following along the Javascript tutorials from plural sight and using their code examples. While I follow along I will take notes in big comment blocks.



## Installation

Download and install nodejs to run your js code
